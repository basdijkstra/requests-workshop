# Parse the response into an XML ElementTree
# Check that the root element name is 'account'
# Check that the root element has no attributes
# Check that the root element has no text

# - there is no account that has a customerId that is not equal to 12212
#   (Use your creativity with the last one here... There is a solution, but I couldn't
