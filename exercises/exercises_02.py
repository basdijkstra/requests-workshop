# Exercise 2.1
# Create a test data object test_data_zip
# with three lines / test cases:
# country code - zip code - place
#           us -    90210 - Beverly Hills
#           it -    50123 - Firenze
#           ca -      Y1A - Whitehorse


# Exercise 2.2
# Write a parameterized test that retrieves user data using
# a GET call to https://api.zippopotam.us/<country_code>/<zip_code>
# and checks that the values for the 'place name' elements correspond
# to those that are specified in the test data object


# Exercise 2.3
# Create the same test data as above, but now in a .csv file, for example:
# us,90210,Beverly Hills
# it,50123,Firenze
# ca,Y1A,Whitehorse
# Place this .csv file in the answers folder of the project


# Exercise 2.4
# Create a method read_data_from_csv() that reads the file from 2.3 line by line
# and creates and returns a test data object from the data in the .csv file


# Exercise 2.5
# Change the data driven test from Exercise 2.2 so that it uses the test data
# from the .csv file instead of the test data that was hard coded in this file
