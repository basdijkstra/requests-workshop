Workshop: Testing RESTful APIs in Python with requests
==================
For those of you looking to gain some experience working with [requests](https://requests.readthedocs.io/en/master/), here are all the materials from a workshop I've created and delivered multiple times to good reviews. Feel free to use, share and adapt these materials as you see fit.

Setting up your system
---
1) Make sure you have a working Python 3 installation. Get it from [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/) if you haven't got that already.
2) Download and unzip or clone this project
3) From the project root, run `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the necessary dependencies

What API is used for the exercises?
---
The exercises use the [Zippopotam.us API](http://api.zippopotam.us/), so make sure that it's up and that you are allowed to access it from your machine.

Slides
---
The .pptx/.pdf/.odp file in the root folder contains all slides from the workshop. Again, feel free to use, share and adapt them to fit your own requirements.

Comments? Saying thanks?
---
Feel free to file an issue here or send me an email at bas@ontestautomation.com.

I'd rather have you deliver the workshop instead...
---
Sure, I'd love to. Again, send me an email and I'll be happy to discuss options. In house or at your conference, I'm sure we can work something out.
